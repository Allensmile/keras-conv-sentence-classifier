# Keras Convolutional Sentence Classifier

Finn.no Keras implementation of [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification‚Äù based architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf).

## Finn.no usage
Blog post COMING SOON

## Word-embeddings
COMING SOON


## Disclaimer
Has only been tested with:
* Keras 2.0.2
* Tensorflow 1.0.2


### TODOs
* We plan to eventually release our word-embeddings trained on [finn.no/torget](www.finn.no/torget) data.
* Add requirements.txt
* Add example usage notebook
* Add util-methods for seeing the results of similarity-predictions from the feature-layer of the model.
